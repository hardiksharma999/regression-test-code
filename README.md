# **Hello World Application with Regression Testing**

This repository contains a simple Node.js application that provides an endpoint to evaluate an integer. The application includes unit tests and regression tests for one endpoint that responds with whether the integer is "high" or "low" based on a threshold of 100.

## **Requirements**

- **Node.js** (v18 or later)
- **Docker** (for containerization)
- **Docker Compose** (if using multi-container setups)

## **Getting Started**

### **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hardiksharma999/rsa_group
cd rsa_group
Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the required Node.js dependencies:


npm install
Run the Application
You can run the application locally using:


node app.js
The application will start on http://localhost:3000 (or another port as defined in your app.js).

API Endpoint
The main API endpoint is defined as follows:

Endpoint: /checkInteger

Method: POST

Request Body:

json
{
  "integer": <integer_value>
}
Response:

json
{
  "value": <integer_value>,
  "status": "high" | "low"
}
The response will indicate whether the provided integer is "high" (greater than 100) or "low" (100 or below).

Running Tests
To run the unit and regression tests, use the following command:


npm test
GitHub Actions
This repository is equipped with GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The workflows defined in .github/workflows will automatically:

Run tests on every push.
Build and push Docker images (if applicable).
Building with Docker
To build the application using Docker, use the following command:


docker build -t hello-world-app .
Then, you can run the container:


docker run -p 3000:3000 hello-world-app


vbnet
